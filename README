In order to run our app you will need to do the following:

1.Install NodeJS LTS: 

    https://nodejs.org/en/
    use this link or some other method like a software repositiory to get NodeJS

2. Install Expo using the following command: 
    
    npm install --global expo-cli

3. Verify Expo works with this command :
    
    expo whoami

4. Get our code from our github :

    https://github.com/bluefire8421/DeliveryApp

5. Get all packages used for our project using this command:

    npm install

6. Now you can either run our project via an android emulator or on an actual android device.

    6a. For an android emulator, I used Android Studio to get this emulator:

        https://developer.android.com/studio/install
        https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator

    6b. To run on hardware, download the expo app:

        https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US

7. Now in the same directory where you stored our project code run the following command:

    expo start

    This will start a run time of the expo server. This will open a web page on your broswer,
    and on both the console and on the webpage there will be a QR code displayed

8. Now run the app, which varies depending on emulator or hardware use:

    8a. Press 'a' in the same console where the expo server instance is running
        Alternatively on the webpage that will open there will be a button to launch app on android device

    8b. Launch the expo app on your android device, use the QR code scanner to scan the project QR code
