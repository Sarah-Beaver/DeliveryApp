Stuff needed to install to use naigation stuff. we havent used the tabs or drawers yet, but im sure we will
as we edit the app further

Also I was using expo cli instead of the react native cli, just due to being told it was easier via my
tutorial, but it should be easy enough to change if needed

npm install --save react-navigation@latest
npm install --save react-navigation-stack
npm install --save react-navigation-tabs
npm install --save react-navigation-drawer
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
